> This project was developed for the CSCI6461 Computer Architecture course during my masters studies at the George Washington University.

A Complex Instruction Set (CISC) computer simulator.

## Build and Run

This simulator has been built using version `65` of the Java Runtime, and may not work with older versions.

To build the simulator, run:

```bash
make
```

Then to launch the simulator from the build, run:

```bash
make run
```

If you need to clean up the build files, run:

```
make clean
```
